# FizzBuzz
I created this FizzBuzz application to understand and practice the tenets of Object Oriented Programming.


1. Inheritance has been employed in the fizzBuzz input package
2. Data and Methods have been encapsulated in related packages
3. Runtime Polymorphism has been used to select appropiate functionality(basic vs advanced)

I tried to test my application using few JUnit tests in fizzBuzzTest class.
